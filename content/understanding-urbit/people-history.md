So who builds this thing? Where does it come from? What’s the history?

Today, Urbit is built and maintained by a few companies, a community of contributors and core developers, infrastructure (star) operators, and governance (galaxy) node owners.

Let’s talk first about these individual groups within the Urbit community, then about the history of the project and how it came to be.

<img class="ba" src="https://media.urbit.org/site/understanding-urbit/project-history/project-status-landscape-earth@2x.png">

Around 2013, [Tlon](https://tlon.io) was started to take Urbit from a rough prototype to a real, working system. Tlon was granted about half of the Urbit address space and has used that to fund its operations so far by selling some to the public, some to investors and giving some to contributors and developers.

From 2013 to 2018 Tlon was a tiny team of ~5 people, but it has since grown to about 20 full-time people. Tlon’s focus is to make Urbit both a great system and a great user-experience. As of late 2020, you can sign up for a hosted Urbit from Tlon at [their website](https://tlon.io).

When Tlon’s original address space grant was set up a large chunk of it was earmarked for ‘urbit.org’, a future foundation to support core development. We took our first steps toward making urbit.org a real institution in 2020, which you can read about [here](https://urbit.org/blog/first-steps-towards-urbit-org/). Doing this has ramped up our community grants program.

In 2019, other Urbit companies started to crop up. [urbit.live](https://urbit.live) was the first. They sell Urbit IDs and host a network explorer.

Since then, there are a handful of others: [urth.systems](https://urth.systems) runs private communities on urbit, [planet.market](https://planet.market) sells address space, [urbit.me](https://urbit.me) sells unique sigils, [geturbitid.com](https://geturbitid.com) sells urbit hosting. The ecosystem is healthy and growing steadily.

The community of contributors and core developers has been continuously contributing to the code base since before Tlon existed, and they’re still going strong. They can primarily be found on Urbit itself, in the Urbit Community (`~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`), the [urbit-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!forum/dev) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbit).

When the Urbit ID address space went on-chain in early 2019 there were about 2,000 star holders and 70 galaxy holders. That number has since grown significantly, but we can’t be exactly sure how many *people* are holding address space since everything is on-chain now.

Given how new and unusual Urbit is, it attracts a wide variety of interesting people — both technical and non-technical. The community is generally happy to talk to people about what Urbit is, what we’re up to, and where we’re going. The best way to get involved is to simply join the Urbit Community at `~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community` — which our [setup instructions](/using/operations/using-your-ship/) can help you do.

For those interested in contributing there are some simple instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-urbit), but we also run a [grants program](https://grants.urbit.org/) where we reward contributors with Urbit ID address space. Grants aren’t solely for pre-determined projects, either. If you have something you’d like to propose, we’d love to hear from you.

At the beginning, Urbit was just a few people with the right combination of imagination and discipline to try to rebuild computing.

**2002**

Urbit starts as an open-ended personal project. An “independent study PhD” to reinvent computing for a network-centric world.

**2008**

Nock, the foundation of Urbit, works. Coming in at 32 lines of code, that’s 1 line of code every two months.

**2012**

Hoon, Urbit’s programming language, compiles itself to Nock. Writing Hoon is much easier than writing Nock.

**2013**

Arvo, Urbit’s OS kernel, boots and the first live Urbit network is started with a command-line chat.

**2014**

Tlon is fully up and running to help support Urbit development (and is < 8 people for the next four years).

**2015**

Urbit has its first web interface and serves its own website.

**2016**

The first sale of Urbit address space sells out in four hours.

**2017**

Our test network runs for ten months without a reboot.

Our private sale, shared only with our mailing list, sells 1024 stars in six hours — limit two per person.

**2018**

Tlon sells about 8% of its stake in the network to accelerate Urbit development.

**2019**

Tlon spends the year stabilizing Arvo and building OS 1. urbit.live gets going and starts selling Urbit IDs to the public.

**2020**

[OS 1 is released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ViyftPkGk), Tlon [announces hosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qKe_WZr50), urbit.org accelerates community development and a few other companies get off the ground.

Building Urbit is about building a future where technology doesn’t control us. Instead, we look forward to a future where technology is simpler, more reliable and less invasive.

Keep in touch while we make build this vision into reality by [joining our mailing list](https://urbit.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=972a03db9e0c6c25bb58de8c8&id=be143888d2) or following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/urbit) or [GitHub](https://github.com/urbit).

If you’re somewhat technical and you’d like to help and contribute, [install Urbit](/using/install) and consider [applying for a grant](https://grants.urbit.org/s).

If you’re interested in homesteading a community when OS 1 comes out, [apply here](/community/community-grants).
